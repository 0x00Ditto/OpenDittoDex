# OpenDittoDex
DittoDex is a OpenSource Project which aims to create a pokedex resembling that of Pokemon Kanto

## The history of the project?

This project started with a simple exercise from FreeCodeCamp. But I want to make it bigger for the fans of the Pok√©mon franchise.

## My biggest problem with this project?
The biggest problem I encountered is with my HTML and CSS. I use a Figma plugin to import my design from Figma to code,
but the extension generates code that is very unreadable and makes it very difficult to debug and edit.
